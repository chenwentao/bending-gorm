This application illustrates the use of Hibernate XML mapping files to map
Grails domain classes to a database schema that deviates from the standard
Grails conventions.

-This application uses a MySQL database named round_table_unconventional_dev.
See the README_MYSQL file for details on setting up that database schema.

-You may need to execute `grails upgrade` prior to running the app or running
the tests.

-Areas of Interest

--One-to-many relationships -- Check out the domain classes in
grails-app/domain. In there you'll find the Knight and Sword domain classes.
Knights have many swords, and swords belong to knights.

--Hibernate Mapping Files -- Have a look at the files in the hibernate
directory. Grails uses those files to determine how to map the domain classes
to/from the non-conforming schema.
