This application illustrates using annotated Groovy beans as your Grails domain
classes. 

-This application uses a MySQL database named round_table_unconventional_dev.
See the README_MYSQL file for details on setting up that database schema.

-You may need to execute `grails upgrade` prior to running the app or running
the tests.

-Areas of Interest

--One-to-many relationships -- Check out the Sword domain class in src/groovy/.
In there you'll find the Sword entity implemented as an annotated Groovy entity
bean. And if you look in src/java, you'll see find the Knight entity
implemented as an EJB3 entity bean. (Knights have many swords, and swords
belong to knights.) Some classes in Java and some in Groovy? That's right! Mix
and match to your heart's content.

--Hibernate Mapping File -- Have a look at the file in the hibernate directory.
When using annotated Groovy beans as your domain classes, you need to register
them in this hibernate.cfg.xml file.
