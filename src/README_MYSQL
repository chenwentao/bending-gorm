Some of the example applications require the use of a MySQL database named
'round_table_unconventional_dev'. This database includes a schema that
deviates from the standard Grails conventions, and the accompanying Grails
applications illustrate various mechanisms for mapping Grails domain objects
to a non-standard schema.

SETUP

    install it first. 
1.  Then, create a database named 'round_table_unconventional_dev'. 
2.  Execute the SQL in 'round_table_unconventional_dev.sql' to build and 
    populate the database.
